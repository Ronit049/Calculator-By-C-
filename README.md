# Calculator-By-C-
Code Of Calculation Of The Two Numbers By C++
🔢 Simple C++ Calculator
A basic calculator application built using C++. This project performs fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It runs in the console and allows the user to input an operator and two operands to get the result.

📌 Features
Simple and easy-to-understand console interface

Supports four arithmetic operations:

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/)

Includes error handling for:

Division by zero

Invalid operator input

🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: C++

Compiler: g++ / Any C++ compiler

IDE (optional): Code::Blocks, Dev C++, VS Code, etc.

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository (or copy the code).

Compile the code using a C++ compiler:

bash
Copy
Edit
g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator
./calculator
Follow the on-screen prompts:

Enter an operator: +, -, *, or /

Enter two numbers

View the result in the console

📷 Example Output
vbnet
Copy
Edit
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): +
Enter the numbers to calculate: 10 5
Result: 15
📚 Learning Objectives
Understanding user input/output in C++

Using conditional statements (switch, if)

Working with arithmetic operators

Basic error checking

🔄 Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)
Add a loop to perform multiple calculations until the user exits

Extend support for more operations (modulus, power, etc.)

Create a GUI version using frameworks like Qt or SFML

Store calculation history in a file
